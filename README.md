# Onepipe-Hydronic-Design-Tool

README
  Onepipe_design is a tool for onepipe hydronic heating systems design. It 
  computes heat exchanger sizes and water mass flows according to required 
  heat flow values. It builds the whole design task as an optimization 
  problem.  
  
  To set the design values use file 'Onepipe_design_setup.xlsm'. After the 
  computation is finished, results will be displayed in a file 
  'Onepipe_design_result.xlsx'. To learn more about the tool usage please 
  read the 'Manual.pdf' file.

# Onepipe-Hydronic-Design-Tool

Onepipe_design is a tool for onepipe hydronic heating systems design. It 
computes heat exchanger sizes and water mass flows according to required 
heat flow values. It builds the whole design task as an optimization 
problem.  

## Getting started

You can get the zipped file from "". 

## Installing

Unzip the downloaded archive

## Run the optimization
  
To set the design values use file 'Onepipe_design_setup.xlsm'. After the 
computation is finished, results will be displayed in a file 
'Onepipe_design_result.xlsx'. To learn more about the tool usage please 
read the 'Manual.pdf' file.

# Onepipe-Hydronic-Design-Tool

Onepipe_design is a tool for a onepipe hydronic heating systems design. It 
computes heat exchanger sizes and water mass flows according to the required 
heat flow values. It builds the whole design task as an optimization 
problem.  

## System requirements
* **Windows**. The tool runs an .exe file which limits its utilization for Windows. 
* **Microsoft Excel**. The user interface is implemented in a MS Excel file. It was not tested using any another office suite.  
* **MS Excel macros enabled**. It is necessary to have the MS Excel macros enabled, otherwise the optimization program cannot be executed. 

## Getting started

To get this tool please download the zipped file from https://github.com/UCEEB/Onepipe-Hydronic-Design-Tool/releases. 

## Installing

Unzip the downloaded archive to a directory on your computer.

## Features:
* Computation of optimal sizes of heat exchangers and mass flows.
* Solution of systems with a limited heat exchangers catalogue.
* Option to add a custom heat exchangers catalogue list.
* Easy data input through a Microsoft Excel file.

## Run the optimization
  
To set the design values use a *Onepipe_design_setup.xlsm* file. After the 
computation is finished, results will be displayed in a 
*Onepipe_design_result.xlsx* file. To learn more about the tool utilization please 
read the *Manual_EN.pdf* file.
